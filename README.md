# US_Flight-delays-using-Tableau
In this project we want to clarify the delay and the cancelation of flights in which airports and which carriers in USA. And I created 4 dashboards that will answers the below questions:


1- What are the percentages of flight delays or cancelled/diverted arrivals and Which months had the highest flight delayed or cancelled, and which carrier types and airports?

2-Find the carriers that have the most delays and what are the airports with different carrier?

3-Find the airport that caused the most delays with specific carrier?

4-What are the highest 10 airports and carriers that causes the delays, also what will happen if we combine them together?
